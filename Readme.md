# Python Notes

This repo will contain short notes, snippets, challenges and solutions I encounter while learning Python.

## Why I'm learning Python

Javascript is a great language and I know enough to be dangerous (majorly React and some NodeJS on the backend). There's abundance of jobs with this stack. I would even argue most programming jobs come in this stack. Despite this, limiting myself to Javascript is a bad idea. Here's a few facts I've understood lately

- Extremely good engineers are not bound by languages
- More languages help build a stronger CS background
- Python is great for futuristic stuff

So I'm giving this a shot ðŸ”«
